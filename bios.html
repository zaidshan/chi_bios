<p>I am very happy to have been selected as one of this year’s Cultural Heritage Informatics fellows.  My name is Shanti Zaid and I was raised in Boulder, Colorado but have lived in Michigan on and off for the last ten years.  I am a graduate student at Michigan State University pursuing dual PhD degrees in both African American and African Studies, and in Socio-Cultural Anthropology.  I received my BA in History from MSU and earned MA degrees in Social Anthropology and Migration/Diaspora Studies from the University of London.  My research interests include African Diaspora history and cultural traditions with an emphasis on diasporic religious forms. Currently, I study Africa-inspired religious traditions in eastern Cuba, with attention to the bodily practices and social networks of communities who practice more than one religious tradition.</p>
